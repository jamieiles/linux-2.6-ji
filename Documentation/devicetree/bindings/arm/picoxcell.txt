Picochip picoXcell device tree bindings.
========================================

Required root node properties:
    - compatible:
	- "picochip,pc7302-pc3x3" : PC7302 development board with PC3X3 device.
	- "picochip,pc3x3" : picoXcell PC3X3 device based board.
	- "picochip,pc3x2" : picoXcell PC3X2 device based board.

Timers required properties:
    - compatible = "picochip,pc3x2-timer"
    - interrupts : The single IRQ line for the timer.
    - clock-freq : The frequency in HZ of the timer.
    - reg : The register bank for the timer.

Note: two timers are required - one for the scheduler clock and one for the
event tick/NOHZ.

VIC required properties:
    - compatible = "arm,pl192-vic-pair".
    - interrupt-controller.
    - reg : The register bank for the devices.  Picoxcell has two VIC's and the
      IRQ outputs are wire-OR'd together so we effectively have a combined
      controller that handles 64 IRQ's.  The first reg tuple is the register
      bank of the VIC that generates IRQ's 0->31 and the second tuple handles
      IRQ's 32->63.
    - #interrupt-cells : Must be 1.

Fixed Clocks
------------

Fixed clock required properties:
    - compatible = "fixed-clock".
    - clock-outputs : Comma separated list of names of clock outputs.
    - clock-frequency : The rate of the clock output in Hz.

Fixed clock optional properties:
    - ref-clock : The parent of the clock.  Must be in the form of <&phandle>,
      "output name".
