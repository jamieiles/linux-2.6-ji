Common Interrupt Binding Details

For controllers that need to encode trigger types and senses, where possible
it is encouraged to use the following encoding (a direct mapping of the
IRQF_TRIGGER_* constants in include/linux/interrupt.h):

	bits[3:0] trigger type and level flags.
		1 = low-to-high edge triggered
		2 = high-to-low edge triggered
		4 = active high level-sensitive
		8 = active low level-sensitive

For example, an interrupt may be encoded as (with #interrupt-cells = <2>):

	interrupts = <4 0x3>;

to have interrupt 4 raise an interrupt on both edges of the input.
