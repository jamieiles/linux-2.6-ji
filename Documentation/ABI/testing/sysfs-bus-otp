Description:
		The otp (One Time Programmable memory) bus presents a number
		of devices where each device represents and OTP device in the
		system.  An OTP device may have a number of regions (which can
		be thought of as partitions) and the regions are child
		devices.  Each region will create a device node which allows
		the region to be written with read()/write() calls and the
		device on the bus has attributes for controlling the
		redundancy format and getting the region size.

Description:
		Each otp# directory represents an OTP device in the system.
		The device has attributes that affect all of the regions in
		the device such as write_enable and the number of regions.

Description:
		Each otp#N directory represents a region in the otp# device.
		A region may be read from/written to through the character
		device node named after the otp#N name.

Description:
		This file controls whether the OTP device can be written to.
		If set to "enabled" then the regions may be written, the
		number of regions may be changed and the format of any region
		may be changed.

Description:
		This file controls the number of regions in the OTP device.
		Valid values are 1, 2, 4 and 8. The number of regions may be
		increased but never decreased. Increasing the number of
		regions will create new devices on the otp bus.

Description:
		This file indicates whether all words in a redundant format
		must be programmed correctly to indicate success.  For
		example, using the "redundant format", the same word is
		written to two locations and wire-OR'd when reading back.
		Disabling this will mean that programming will be considered a
		success if the word can be read back correctly in its
		redundant format even if there are bit errors when programming
		the extra redundancy words.

Contact:        Jamie Iles <jamie@jamieiles.com>
Description:
                The redundancy format of the region. Valid values are:
			- single-ended (1 bit of storage per data bit).
			- redundant (2 bits of storage, wire-OR'd per data
			  bit).
			- differential (2 bits of storage, differential
			  voltage per data bit).
			- differential-redundant (4 bits of storage, combining
			  redundant and differential).
			- ecc (transparent to the user)
		Depending on the device type, it may be possible to increase
		redundancy of a region but care will be needed if there is
		data already in the region.

Description:
                The effective storage size of the region. This is the amount
		of data that a user can store in the region taking into
		account the number of regions and the redundancy format of the
		region itself.
