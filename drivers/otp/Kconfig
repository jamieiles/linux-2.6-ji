	bool "OTP memory support"
	help
	  Say Y here to support OTP (One Time Programmable) memory.  This
	  memory can commonly be used to store boot code, cryptographic keys
	  and other persistent data.  This memory is typically a few KBytes in
	  size and different devices may have different characteristics.  This
	  provides a character device interface to these devices to allow the
	  OTP to be programmed and read.

if OTP

config OTP_WRITE_ENABLE
	bool "Enable writing support of OTP pages"
	default n
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will enable support for writing of the
	  OTP pages.  This is dangerous by nature as you can only program
	  the pages once, so only enable this option when you actually
	  need it so as to not inadvertently clobber data.

	  If unsure, say N.

config OTP_PC3X3
	tristate "Enable support for Picochip PC3X3 OTP"
	depends on ARCH_PICOXCELL
	help
	  Say Y or M here to allow support for the OTP found in PC3X3 devices.
	  If you say M then the module will be called otp_pc3x3.
